- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArchiSec-IT
- 👀 I’m interested in an Open Source Database Vulnerability Scanner
- 🌱 I developed the core of the system, and I am developing the modules containing the scripts to scan a specific database.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the structure of databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, DB2, etc. to develop the modules containing scripts to scan databases.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on the development of modules that will allow to scan the databases, and the development of the graphical interface of the program.
- 📫 How to reach me : archisec.it@gmail.com or https://t.me/ArchiSecIT
